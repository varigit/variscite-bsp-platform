= Variscite BSP Platform (based on NXP Yocto BSP)

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

[source,console]
$ mkdir ~/bin
$ curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$ PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$ mkdir ~/var-fsl-yocto
$ cd ~/var-fsl-yocto
$ repo init -u https://github.com/varigit/variscite-bsp-platform.git -b fsl-zeus
$ repo sync -j4

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a simple image build:

[source,console]
$ MACHINE=<machine> DISTRO=<distro> source ./var-setup-release.sh -b <build directory>
$ bitbake core-image-base

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code is checked out at `var-fsl-yocto/sources`.
